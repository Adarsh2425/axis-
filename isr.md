// Timer 2 Compare A Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)
// ISR Name: timer2_compa_isr
// Purpose: Generates a pulse of approximately 100 microseconds duration on PORTF.0 pin.
//          This pulse might be used for triggering external devices or as a general-purpose timing signal.

// Timer 1 Output Compare A Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)
// ISR Name: timer1_compa_isr
// Purpose: This ISR is the heart of the motor control system. It's triggered by Timer 1 reaching the value set in OCR1A.
//          It's responsible for:
//          1. Updating OCR values to control motor speed (indirectly through `ChangeOCR` and `ChangeOCRforHoming`).
//          2. Stepping the motor phases to achieve rotation using `StepOut()`.
//          3. Handling special motion modes like homing, master/slave axis interpolation, and arc motion.
//
// For someone new to embedded C:
// - Timer 1: A hardware timer in the microcontroller. When configured in CTC mode with Output Compare,
//            it generates an interrupt when the timer counter reaches the value in OCR1A.
// - OCR1A: Output Compare Register A for Timer 1. Setting this value and starting Timer 1
//          causes the timer to count, and when the count matches OCR1A, this ISR is triggered.
//          By dynamically changing OCR1A, we control the time interval between interrupts, thus controlling motor speed.

// SPI interrupt service routine
// ISR Name: spi_isr
// Purpose: This ISR is triggered when a byte of data is received via SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface).
//          It's used for receiving commands from a master controller (e.g., a host PC or another microcontroller) over SPI.
//          The received commands are stored in the `CurrentCommand` buffer and processed by `ProcessCommand()` when a complete command is received.
//
// For someone new to embedded C:
// - SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface): A synchronous serial communication protocol used for short-distance, high-speed communication between microcontrollers and peripherals.
// - SPDR (SPI Data Register): The SPI Data Register. Writing to SPDR transmits data, and reading from SPDR receives data in SPI communication.

    {
           CurrentCommand[CurrentCommandPtr++] = data; // Store the received data byte into the CurrentCommand buffer at the position indicated by CurrentCommandPtr, then increment CurrentCommandPtr.
           if(CurrentCommandPtr == 8) // Check if 8 bytes have been received. Assuming commands are 8 bytes long.
            {
              IsCommandReceived = TRUE; // Set IsCommandReceived flag to TRUE. Indicate that a complete command of 8 bytes has been received.
              PORT = (PING | AXIS_BUSY);   // Set AXIS_BUSY flag in PORT (set PG.2 HIGH - changed on 8Aug2023). Indicate to the master that the axis is now busy processing a command.

This detailed explanation with comments should be helpful for someone new to embedded C and motor control to understand the ISR code and its role in the system. Remember that some of the commented-out code or unclear parts might be remnants of older versions or debugging code, and the exact purpose of some flags or PORTF bits might require further hardware documentation or context of the overall project.
